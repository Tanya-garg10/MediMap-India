# 🏥 MediMap-India

**AI-powered healthcare discovery platform for India — turning 10,000 static hospital records into a living intelligence network.**

Search any city, state, or specialty in natural language. Every result comes with a Trust Score, AI reasoning chain, contradiction detection, and fraud flagging.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Natural Language Search** — "emergency dialysis hospital in Bihar" just works
- 🛡️ **AI Trust Scoring** — Every facility scored as High / Medium / Low / Flagged

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/query?q=...` | Natural language hospital search |
| GET | `/hospitals/map` | All hospitals with coordinates |
| GET | `/stats` | Aggregate statistics |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

## 🧠 How Trust Scoring Works

The AI analyzes each hospital record for:

| Signal | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ✅ NABH accredited | Verified accreditation | +20 points |
| ✅ Government operated | Central/State govt | +15 points |
| ✅ 24hr anesthesiologist | Round-the-clock staff | +15 points |
| ⚠️ Claims surgery, no anesthesiologist | Contradiction | -25 points |
| ⚠️ Claims ICU, zero beds | Mismatch | -20 points |
| 🚨 Multiple unverified claims | "Claimed: Cardiac, Neuro" | -30 points |
| 🚨 License not found | NMC registry miss | -35 points |

**Final Score:**
- 🟢 **High Trust** (30+ points) — Safe for referral
- 🟡 **Medium Trust** (0-29 points) — Call ahead
- 🔴 **Low Trust** (below 0) — Do not rely
- ⚫ **Flagged** (fraud detected) — DO NOT refer
